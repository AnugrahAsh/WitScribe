Subject: Cracked Builder Ready to Ship (and Ship Fast) 🚀

Hi Person,

I’m Anugrah, a college student who builds clean products faster than most people finish their coffee. Came across [Company Name] and it immediately clicked—I’m a builder who loves turning ideas into sleek, functional apps that people actually use, and your team seems like the place to level that up.

Quick on me: I’ve shipped SimpleYelpCamp, Shlok (Hindu resources platform), TaskKitty (productivity with cat agents), WitScribe (AI-powered YouTube summarizer) won a hackathon with it too, and NoodleUI (customizable UI component library)—all before graduating. I design, build, write clean code, and launch, then repeat until it’s right. I also obsess over micro-interactions and minimal design so users love sticking around.

I’m cracked at figuring out what users actually want (even if they don’t say it out loud), can talk to customers, and push features fast without making a mess. Need someone to help with designing, shipping frontend/features, handling user testing, or even fixing the annoying CSS bug no one else wants to touch? I’m in.

If you’re down for a call to jam on how I can support [Company Name] (or if you just want someone to geek out about design systems with), let me know. Would love to contribute this summer and learn from the team while helping you move fast without breaking too many things.

Best,
Your Future Intern (if you’ll have me), Anugrah Sharma

P.S. I can send memes while fixing bugs if that helps team morale. 🐱
